const driver = {};

// updateDriverWithKeyAndValue()- this function should take in three arguments: a driver Object, a key and a value. This function should not mutate the driver and should return a new driver that has an updated value for the key passed in.

function updateDriverWithKeyAndValue(driver, key, value) {
    const newDriver = {...driver};
    newDriver[key] = value;
    return newDriver;

// destructivelyUpdateDriverWithKeyAndValue() - this function should work the same as updateDriverWithKeyAndValue() but it should mutate the driver parameter passed in.

function destructivelyUpdateDriverWithKeyAndValue(driver, key, value) {
    driver[key] = value;
    return driver;
}

// deleteFromDriverByKey() - this function should take in a driver Object and a key. It should delete the key/value pair for the key that was passed in from the driver Object. This should all not actually mutate the driver passed in.

function deleteFromDriverByKey(driver, key) {
    const newDriver = {...driver};
    delete newDriver[key];
    return newDriver;
}

// destructivelyDeleteFromDriverByKey() - this function should work the same as deleteFromDriverByKey() but it should mutate the driver passed in. 

function destructivelyDeleteFromDriverByKey(driver, key) {
    delete driver[key];
    return driver;
